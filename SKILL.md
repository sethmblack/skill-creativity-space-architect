# Creativity Space Architect

Implement John Cleese's 5-factor creativity framework to design optimal conditions for creative work: Space, Time, Time (incubation), Confidence, and Humor.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create environments that isolate people harmfully or manipulate them
- Design conditions that exploit workers or remove necessary breaks
- Use "creativity optimization" to justify overwork or unreasonable demands

**Ethical Application:** This skill creates conditions for genuine creative flourishing, not exploitation disguised as innovation.

---

## When to Use

**Invoke this skill when:**
- User faces creative block or needs creativity optimization
- Team needs better creative processes
- Projects require innovation and ideation
- User asks to "create creativity space" or "apply Cleese's creativity framework"
- Organizational environment stifles creative work

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `creative_challenge` | Yes | The problem requiring creative solution | Specific project, problem, or goal |
| `constraints` | Yes | Real limitations (time, budget, space) | Must be realistic |
| `team_size` | No | Number of people involved | Default: individual |

---

## Workflow
### Factor 1: Create Space (Physical and Mental)

**Objective:** Establish boundaries separating creative work from everyday demands.

**Actions:**

### Step 1: Identify physical space away from interruptions



### Step 2: Remove distractions (phones, emails, notifications)



### Step 3: Create mental space by defining boundaries ("I'm unavailable during this time")



### Step 4: Establish "space/time oasis" for uninterrupted thinking



**Output:** Specific space designation with protection from interruptions.

---

### Factor 2: Allocate Time (Sufficient Duration)

**Objective:** Allow enough time for ideas to develop without rushing.

**Actions:**

### Step 1: Schedule dedicated creative sessions (minimum 90 minutes)



### Step 2: Resist pressure to "hurry up" creative process



### Step 3: Plan multiple sessions—creativity can't be compressed



### Step 4: Build buffer time into schedules



**Output:** Time allocation plan with protected creative sessions.

---

### Factor 3: Enable Incubation (Let Ideas Percolate)

**Objective:** Give problems time to incubate; let unconscious mind work.

**Actions:**

### Step 1: After initial creative session, step away



### Step 2: "Keep your mind resting against the subject in a friendly but persistent way"



### Step 3: Allow 24-48 hours between intensive creative sessions



### Step 4: Engage in unrelated activities (walks, hobbies) while unconscious processes



### Step 5: Return to problem after incubation period



**Output:** Incubation strategy with timing and activities.

---

### Factor 4: Build Confidence (Remove Fear of Mistakes)

**Objective:** Create psychological safety for risky, silly, "wrong" ideas.

**Actions:**

### Step 1: Explicitly permit failure: "Nothing will stop you being creative so effectively as the fear of making a mistake"



### Step 2: Separate ideation from evaluation—no judgment during idea generation



### Step 3: Encourage playfulness and "childlike" exploration



### Step 4: Reward unusual ideas, even failed ones



### Step 5: Frame mistakes as learning opportunities



**Output:** Confidence-building protocols and permission structures.

---

### Factor 5: Inject Humor (Shift from Closed to Open Mode)

**Objective:** Use humor to transition from closed (executing) to open (exploring) mode.

**Actions:**

### Step 1: Begin creative sessions with something funny



### Step 2: Encourage playful approaches to problems



### Step 3: Use humor to defuse stress and tension



### Step 4: "Humor gets us from closed mode to open mode quicker than anything else"



### Step 5: Maintain lightness during ideation



**Output:** Humor integration plan for creative sessions.

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `creativity_plan` | Complete implementation of 5 factors |
| `session_structure` | How to run actual creative sessions |
| `measurement` | How to evaluate if conditions are working |

## Integration with John Cleese Expert

This skill applies Cleese's core creativity philosophy:
- **"Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating."**
- **Two Modes:** Open (exploring) and Closed (executing)
- **Structured Playfulness:** Create boundaries that enable freedom

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Space physically and mentally separated from distractions
- [ ] Time allocated without pressure to rush
- [ ] Incubation periods built into process
- [ ] Confidence/safety explicitly established
- [ ] Humor integrated to enable open mode
- [ ] All 5 factors working together systemically

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems
